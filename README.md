# LimitlessGems

It is the Final project for my Bacherlor's degree in Video Game Design and Development.

The game serves as a prototype of an idle game, therefore the main focus is to achieve the intended behaviours and mechanics from a programmer's perspective.

Furthermore, it will be updated with a saving system and an improved UI/UX.
